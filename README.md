# Space Invader Game
Our team created a Space Invader Game using our TM4C Launchpad, a potentiometer, and the Nokia5110. The game starts with a prompt on the Nokia screen telling the player to press the launchpad's switch 2 to start the game. Once the game begins, five enemy sprites appear at the top of the screen while the player's spaceship appears at the bottom. To move the ship, we implemented a potentiometer that allows you to move it from left to right. To terminate any enemies, press the launchpad's switch 1 to shoot a laser. Finally, once all the sprites are either terminated or disappeared from the screen, an end prompt will display showing the player's score and inviting the player to play again.
